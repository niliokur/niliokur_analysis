In this study, Better Life Index in OECD Countries has been analyzed. 'Better Life Index(BTI) has been created to compare well-being across countries, based on 11 topics the OECD has identified as essential, in the areas of material living conditions and quality of life (http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/).'

The main purpose of the study is to extract these data from the OECD website and create a new indicator named as Women Happiness Index(WHI). Eight indicators were chosen to form this new index such as labour market insecurity, employment rate, feeling safe walking alone at night, quality of support network, educational attainment, life expectancy, life satisfaction and time devoted to leisure and personal care.

In this study, the collected data has been prepared for clustering analysis and the given OECD countries have been clustered on the basis of the newly created Women Happiness Index(WHI). Python 3.6 and Jupiter Notebook were utilised on the technical side of the project with the libraries and modules of Pandas, Geopandas, Scipy and Plotly.

A social scientist creates concepts. It is expected that the newly created concept of Women Happiness Index(WHI) will be a focal point of many other academic and scientific studies and will help to create a better perspective to improve women life all over the world.
