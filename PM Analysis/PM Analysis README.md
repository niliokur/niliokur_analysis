## Overview
The **PM Analysis Report** assesses the available Project Managers (PMs) against current project needs. It uses PM start/end dates to determine availability and compares forecasted PM hours to standard hours for requirements.

## Objectives
1. Count current available PMs.
2. Estimate PMs needed for projects.
3. Identify gaps between available and required PMs.

## Metrics & Visuals
- **Start and End Dates**: Charts show PM availability.
- **Forecasted PM Hours**: Graphs of expected PM work hours.
- **Standard Hours**: Typical PM work hours used for projections.
- **Needed PMs**: Calculated from forecasted and standard hours.

## Insights
The report shows whether we have enough PMs for current tasks. Differences might mean adjusting project dates, reallocating tasks, or hiring.

## Usage
Essential for HR and Project Management, this report helps avoid project delays from PM shortages. Checking it regularly ensures smooth project flow.

## Recommendations
Review this report often, especially when starting projects, to ensure we have the PM resources we need.
