Analysing Property Price Index(PPI)  and Regional Internal Migrates in Sydney

Rising property prices in Sydney is a very popular agenda topic of almost all Sydney residents. Sooner or later every conversation reaches the real estate market and usually ends with displeasure statements.

Due to a social scientist nature, rising property prices are expected to affect various areas of life. Therefore, it offers a rich field of study and analysis.

This study targets to figure out whether rising property prices generate an impact on the decision to migrate from Sydney. When international students and other immigrants set aside, Sydney seems to constantly emigrate. The purpose of this study is to try to find out if there is a similar pattern between emigration rates and rising property prices in Sydney.

Of course, emigration is an important decision and cannot be explained by a single variable. However, this study is based on the perspective that residents who cannot afford to live a settled life by buying a house can decide on emigration more easily.

In the first phase of the study, based on data for the last 10 years collected from the ABS(Australian Bureau of Statistics) website, there is a similar pattern was found between property price increases and immigration figures from Sydney. The analysis was performed by utilising Python 3. Pandas and Matlotlib have been used for analysis and visualization.

Apparently, this is an immature study yet. Further analysis will be carried out to support the main perspective of the analysis.
